# WebDev-Project
Web Development with Databases Final Project, Olin College, Fall 2018

The goal of this project is to create automated iCals for the Olin College Spring 2019 Events Calendar and
Course Offerings. Users can access our project via a website. Here, they will choose to be emailed iCals for
the Events Calendar and/or for courses that they will be taking.
